# flutter-london-firestore

This repo contains the sample code for my talk at Flutter London about Firestore in Flutter.

Some warnings:

- This is "demo quality code" and should not be used as sample for best practices.
- Redux implementation is poorly made.
- Really, don't.
- It requires Firebase setup, which is not included.
